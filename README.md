# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing or Incomplete requirements.txt

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: a failure to build due to issues with the `requirements.txt` file.  The original Dockerfile attempts to install Python packages using `pip3`, but the `requirements.txt` file is either missing or does not properly specify the required dependencies.

## Bug

The provided `Dockerfile` will fail to build because the `requirements.txt` file is either missing or incomplete.

## Solution

The `Dockerfile.fixed` demonstrates the correct way to handle dependencies.  A complete `requirements.txt` file is provided that includes `requests`.  Ensure this file exists in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Try to build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t myapp .`  (This should fail.)
3.  Build the fixed `Dockerfile.fixed` using `docker build -t myapp .` (This should succeed.)

## Additional Notes

- Always ensure your `requirements.txt` file is complete and accurate.
- Consider using a virtual environment for better dependency management, even within Docker.
- Check for typos in the file and ensure the package names are correct.
